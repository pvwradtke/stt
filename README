Timelapse Tools
============

Two tools to create time lapses from the user desktop and webcams attached to 
computer. Both tools are open source and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
For further details, sees the pache2.0_license.txt license file.

1 - Building and installation
-----------------------------

To build on a GNU Posix environment, such as Linux, just type "make".

To install, you must have super user rights. Just run "sudo make install". If 
you can't perform this step, you can run the binaries produced by make at this
folder.

If you ever wish to uninstall those great tools, just type "sudo make uninstall".

Finally, to clean up the build, just type "make clean".

On windows, the desktopcapture tool should compile straightforward on Visual
C++ (full or Express editions). As for the webcamcapture, you will need to setup
 OpenCV and HighGui on your system and add both libraries to the project that 
 will compile the tool.

2 - Dependencies
----------------

Besides gcc, g++ and standard libraries, you need the following:

	- OpenCV development libraries and binaries (libcv)
	- OpenCV High GUI development files and binaries (libhighgui)
	- Image Magick Tools, which must be accessible on the system path.

3 - MacOS X Portability
---------------

Given that MacOS X is a Unix based system (FreeBSD), you should be able to 
build the tools on the command line, given that you have OpenCV and Image Magick
properly intalled. Thiswas not tested so far, but there's no reason they should
not compile.
